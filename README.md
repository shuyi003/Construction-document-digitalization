Give the layout detection dataset for construction specifications

Our dataset include page images and labels for each image. These images are from nine construction specification documents in PDF formats. They are:

- Specificaions from United states including Arizona, Arkansas, Federal, Delaware, and Alberta.
- Specifications from Canada including New Brunswick and British Columbia.
- Specifications from Australia.
- Specifications from India.

The images used correspond directly to their associated label files. For example, a label file named Australia_Northern-Territory_2017-pdf48 indicates that the specification originates from the Northern Territory of Australia, published in 2017, and the label pertains to page 48 of that document.

We make use of Roboflow platform for labeling and generating proper dataset format for different layout detection algorithms.
